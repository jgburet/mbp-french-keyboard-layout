# Problem
> the backtick ( ` ) is a dead key on the French Mac keyboard; that is to say that it does not generate a complete character, and that you need to type another key after having typed a backtick for it to show as a single character.

Unfortunaly the offered keyboard layout bundles in the blog post do not seem to work properly with more recent versions of Macbooks.

# Solution
Using [Ukelele](http://software.sil.org/ukelele/) I modified a copy of the original French layout delivered with the OS of my Macbook Pro 16.

## Installation
- Download the `.bundle` folder (it will be displayed as a file on the Finder)
- Keyboard preferences
- Input Sources
- Click the `+` button on the bottom left corner
- Select the `French (backticks)` layout
